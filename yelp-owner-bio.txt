I started Datanalytico in 2024 after years in data analytics and SEO, seeing the same problem — Swiss businesses paying for strategies designed for other markets with little to show for it.

Switzerland is not like other search markets. Multilingual queries, Swiss-specific directories, and regional Google signals need a unique approach. I built an agency that understands this.

My specialty is entity-based local SEO and Google Business Profile strategy — what moves the needle for local businesses: getting found in Google Search, Google Maps, and AI results.

I founded Datanalytico in Basel because Swiss businesses deserve strategies built on real Swiss search data, not assumptions from other markets. Every keyword, competitor analysis and recommendation comes from verified CH data.

I work with businesses in Basel, Zürich and Bern in legal, dental, financial and life sciences. Serving a local Swiss market? I would love to show you where you stand and what it takes to rank higher.
