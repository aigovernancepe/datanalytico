    'home.svc.local-seo': 'Most businesses in Basel and Zurich are invisible in Google Search because their website and Google Business Profile are not structured for local rankings. Datanalytico builds the complete local SEO foundation — keyword targeting, on-page optimization, Swiss business directory citations, and GBP management — so your business appears when local buyers are actively searching. Clients typically see measurable ranking improvements within 60 to 90 days. Talk to us about where you currently rank and where you should be.',
    'home.svc.website-design': 'A website that looks good but does not convert visitors into calls or inquiries is a missed opportunity. Datanalytico builds websites specifically structured for local search — fast-loading, mobile-first, with clear conversion paths and proper schema markup so Google understands what your business does and where you operate. Every site is SEO-ready from day one. Ask us how a purpose-built site could change your lead volume.',
    'home.svc.google-business-profile': 'Google Business Profile is the single highest-ROI channel for most local businesses — 60 to 70% of local leads come through Google Maps. Most profiles are incomplete, unoptimized, and rarely updated, which means competitors with better-managed profiles take those leads instead. Datanalytico handles full GBP optimization and ongoing management: categories, posts, Q&A, photo strategy, and review response. Get in touch to see a free audit of your current profile.',
    'home.svc.content-creation': 'Ranking for local keywords requires content that matches what buyers actually search for — not generic blog posts or keyword-stuffed pages. Datanalytico produces service pages, city pages, and FAQ content built around verified search data for your specific market in Basel, Zurich, and Bern. Every piece is structured to rank in traditional search and to be cited by AI tools like Google\'s AI Overviews. Contact us to see a content plan built around your services.',
    'home.svc.local-social-media': 'Social media activity supports local SEO by building brand signals, driving profile engagement, and reinforcing your business\'s presence across platforms Google monitors. For Swiss B2B businesses, Datanalytico focuses on LinkedIn and Google Business Profile posts — the two channels that directly support local search authority. We handle scheduling, copy, and reporting so your team does not carry the overhead. Ask us how to build a consistent posting schedule that actually moves rankings.',
    'home.svc.google-ads': 'Organic local SEO takes time to build. Google Ads places your business in front of buyers in Basel, Zurich, or Bern immediately — with full control over budget, geography, and targeting. Datanalytico manages Google Search campaigns and Local Services Ads specifically for Swiss businesses, with conversion tracking configured from day one so you see exactly which ads produce calls and form submissions.

Datanalytico does this for businesses in Basel, Zurich, and Bern by optimizing Google Business Profiles, building Swiss-relevant citations, and creating targeted website content that ranks for local search queries.',
    'home.cap.h2': 'How Long Does Local SEO Take to Show Results?',
    'home.cap.p2': 'Local SEO in Switzerland typically produces measurable ranking improvements within 60 to 90 days for low-competition markets and 3 to 6 months for competitive categories like legal, dental, or financial services. Google Business Profile optimization often shows the fastest results, sometimes within the first 30 days of a properly run campaign.',
    'home.cap.h3': 'How Much Does Local SEO Cost in Switzerland?',
    'home.cap.p3': 'Local SEO services in Switzerland typically range from 500 CHF to 2\'500 CHF per month depending on the number of target cities, service categories, and competition level.

    'home.cap.h4': 'Does a Business Need a Website to Rank Locally in Switzerland?',

Swiss businesses face a specific challenge: a multi-language search landscape, country-specific directories, and Google algorithms that treat the CH market differently from larger English-language markets. Every strategy Datanalytico delivers is built on verified search data — keyword volumes, competitor ranking analysis, and GBP performance benchmarks — not assumptions borrowed from other markets. We work with a focused client roster so every business gets direct attention and measurable outcomes, reported each month with full transparency.',

    // Homepage - FAQ
    'home.faq.title': 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    'home.faq.q1': 'How much does local SEO cost for a business in Basel or Zurich?',
    'home.faq.a1': 'Local SEO pricing in Switzerland ranges from 500 CHF to 2\'500 CHF per month based on competition level, number of target locations, and services included. Datanalytico offers fixed-fee monthly plans with no setup fees hidden in the first invoice. Call +41 76 757 64 23 for a pricing conversation specific to your market and service category.',
    'home.faq.q2': 'How long before we see results from local SEO?',
    'home.faq.a2': 'Google Business Profile improvements are often visible within 30 days of proper optimization. Website ranking improvements for local keywords typically take 60 to 90 days in lower-competition markets and 3 to 6 months in competitive verticals like legal, financial, or healthcare services in Basel or Zurich. Datanalytico provides monthly ranking reports so you can track movement from the first campaign week.',
    'home.faq.q3': 'Do you work with businesses that already have a website and Google profile?',
    'home.faq.a3': 'Yes — the majority of Datanalytico\'s clients already have a website and a Google Business Profile but are not ranking where they should be. The first step is always an audit: we assess what exists, identify the gaps causing lost visibility, and build a prioritized action plan. No new website is required unless the existing one has structural issues that prevent ranking.',
    'home.faq.q4': 'What is included in Google Business Profile management?',
    'home.faq.a4': 'Datanalytico\'s GBP management covers initial optimization of all profile fields, category selection, service listings, photo strategy, weekly or biweekly posts, Q&A management, and review response. The GBP is the primary driver of Google Maps visibility, and active ongoing management — not a one-time setup — is what produces consistent ranking gains.',
    'home.faq.q5': 'Do you produce content and GBP posts in German?',
    'home.faq.a5': 'Yes. Datanalytico serves Swiss businesses in the Basel and Bern regions where the primary search language is German. We produce GBP posts, website copy, and local citation content in German where required by the target market. For businesses in multilingual cantons, we can advise on language-targeting strategy across Swiss search queries.',
    'home.faq.q6': 'Is there a long-term contract or minimum commitment?',
    'home.faq.a6': 'Datanalytico does not require long-term contracts. Engagements run month-to-month, and clients own all assets built during the campaign — website content, GBP optimization, and citation profiles. Local SEO produces compounding results over time, and clients stay because the channel performs, not because they are locked in.',
