Datanalytico was founded in 2024 in Basel, Switzerland, born from a simple observation: most digital marketing agencies apply the same strategies to every market, but Swiss local search works differently.

Our founder's background in data analytics and search engine optimization revealed a clear gap. Swiss businesses were paying for generic SEO strategies built for other markets — ignoring the multilingual search dynamics, country-specific directories, and regional Google algorithm signals unique to Switzerland.

Datanalytico was built to fill that gap. The name itself reflects our core philosophy — combining data and analytics to drive every decision. No guesswork, no borrowed playbooks. Just verified Swiss search data applied to real local businesses in Basel, Zürich, and Bern.

From day one, we chose to specialize rather than generalize. We work exclusively with local Swiss businesses and focus entirely on making them visible in Google Search, Google Maps, and AI-generated results. That focus allows us to deliver better results, faster.

What started as one founder's mission to bring data-driven local SEO to Switzerland has grown into a trusted agency serving businesses across legal, dental, financial, life sciences, and professional services. Every strategy we build is grounded in the Swiss market — because that is the only market we serve.
