Datanalytico was founded in 2024 in Basel, Switzerland, from a simple observation: most agencies apply the same strategies to every market, but Swiss local search works differently.

Our founder's background in data analytics and SEO revealed a clear gap. Swiss businesses were paying for generic strategies built for other markets — ignoring multilingual search dynamics, country-specific directories, and regional Google signals unique to Switzerland.

Datanalytico was built to fill that gap. The name reflects our philosophy — combining data and analytics to drive every decision. No guesswork, no borrowed playbooks. Just verified Swiss search data applied to local businesses in Basel, Zürich, and Bern.

From day one, we specialized. We work exclusively with local Swiss businesses, making them visible in Google Search, Google Maps, and AI results. What began as one founder's mission has grown into a trusted agency serving legal, dental, financial and professional service businesses.
