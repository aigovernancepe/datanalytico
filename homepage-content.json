      "question": "How much does local SEO cost for a business in Basel or Zurich?",
      "answer": "Local SEO pricing in Switzerland ranges from CHF 500 to CHF 2,500 per month based on competition level, number of target locations, and services included. Datanalytico offers fixed-fee monthly plans with no setup fees hidden in the first invoice. Call +41 76 757 64 23 for a pricing conversation specific to your market and service category."

    {
      "question": "How long before we see results from local SEO?",
      "answer": "Google Business Profile improvements are often visible within 30 days of proper optimization. Website ranking improvements for local keywords typically take 60 to 90 days in lower-competition markets and 3 to 6 months in competitive verticals like legal, financial, or healthcare services in Basel or Zurich. Datanalytico provides monthly ranking reports so you can track movement from the first campaign week."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses that already have a website and Google profile?",
      "answer": "Yes — the majority of Datanalytico's clients already have a website and a Google Business Profile but are not ranking where they should be. The first step is always an audit: we assess what exists, identify the gaps causing lost visibility, and build a prioritized action plan. No new website is required unless the existing one has structural issues that prevent ranking."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is included in Google Business Profile management?",
      "answer": "Datanalytico's GBP management covers initial optimization of all profile fields, category selection, service listings, photo strategy, weekly or biweekly posts, Q&A management, and review response. The GBP is the primary driver of Google Maps visibility, and active ongoing management — not a one-time setup — is what produces consistent ranking gains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you produce content and GBP posts in German?",
      "answer": "Yes. Datanalytico serves Swiss businesses in the Basel and Bern regions where the primary search language is German. We produce GBP posts, website copy, and local citation content in German where required by the target market. For businesses in multilingual cantons, we can advise on language-targeting strategy across Swiss search queries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a long-term contract or minimum commitment?",
      "answer": "Datanalytico does not require long-term contracts. Engagements run month-to-month, and clients own all assets built during the campaign — website content, GBP optimization, and citation profiles. Local SEO produces compounding results over time, and clients stay because the channel performs, not because they are locked in."
